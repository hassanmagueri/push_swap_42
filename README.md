#Push Swap Project
Overview
The Push Swap project is a program written in C that sorts a stack of integers using a predefined set of operations. This project is part of the curriculum for [INSERT NAME OF YOUR COURSE OR PROGRAM HERE].

Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you'll need:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
GNU Make
Building the Project
To build the Push Swap program, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
make
This will compile the source code and create an executable file named push_swap.

Usage
Once the project is built, you can use the push_swap executable to sort a stack of integers. Here's how you can use it:

bash
Copy code
./push_swap [list of integers]
Replace [list of integers] with the integers you want to sort, separated by spaces. For example:

bash
Copy code
./push_swap 3 1 4 2 5
This command will output a series of operations to sort the integers.

Testing
To test the Push Swap program, you can use the provided test cases or create your own. Test cases are located in the tests directory. To run the tests, execute:

bash
Copy code
make test
This will run the program with the test cases and compare the output with the expected results.
